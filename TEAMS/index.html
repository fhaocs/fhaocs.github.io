			  <p><strong>Project Introduction:</strong></p>
				<p align="justify">Users’ experience with real-world social systems (e.g., Epinions and eBay) witnesses the importance of Signed Social Networks (SSNs) that have wide practical and valuable applications in social media such as opinion guidance, personalized recommendation, and topic identification. However, the diversity of massive social interactions complicates the trust and distrust relations among users in SSNs. In particular, the complexity of distrust relations leads to significant challenges in detecting the trusted communities and capturing their evolutionary patterns. This research aims to pioneer the innovative mechanisms for detecting the trusted communities and learning the evolutionary dynamics. To this end, we will explore the representation mechanism for SSNs by using the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) and develop a FCA-based representation model. Next, the mechanisms and corresponding algorithms for detecting trusted communities and identifying their dynamic evolutions will be investigated. This research will provide both theoretical fundamentals and practical techniques for detection and dynamic evolution of trusted communities in SSNs. Moreover, this project can stimulate new research directions and the collaborative opportunities across multiple disciplines, such as social computing, soft computing and networking. To broaden the fellow’s knowledge horizon, a series of research, training, and knowledge transfer activities are planned. The new knowledge and skills imparted in these activities will further promote the applicant’s research portfolio and significantly enhance his career prosperity. The research will also lay a solid foundation for the longterm and wide-range collaborations between the fellow and the host university, and eventually lead to more extensive and higher impact of research results, from which both EU and China will benefit. </p>
